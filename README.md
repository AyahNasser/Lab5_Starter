1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user. No, I would not, since a unit test would not catch issues and bugs for many components interacting with each other, and this could be a waste of time to use a unit test here. 

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters. Yes, I would since in this feature we are testing this specific feature which does not interact with so many other components, so it would be a good idea to use unit tests to catch bugs and issues and make sure that everything works the way we want it to work.
